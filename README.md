This example shows how to load [Avagi3D] avatars using three.js.


# Build

There is nothing to build, just run a http server in this folder. You can install one with e.g.: 

```bash
npm install -g local-web-server
```

And then run 

```bash
ws
```

The server will open up at `http://localhost:8000`
